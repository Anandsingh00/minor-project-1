# Weather App

The Weather App is a simple, responsive web application that allows users to retrieve real-time weather information by entering a city name. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live temperature and weather descriptions. It offers a clean and modern user interface with a visually appealing glassmorphism design, enhancing user experience across devices.

The application handles user inputs gracefully, including error cases such as entering an invalid city. With minimal setup required, the Weather App can be run locally in any modern web browser without the need for a backend server.

This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript's Fetch API for asynchronous data fetching, dynamic DOM manipulation, and responsive UI design principles.
